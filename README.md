SilverBot Plugins
=================

Overview
--------
These plugins were built to interface with the SilverBot PHP IRC Bot framework. 

Usage
-----
Setup a SilverBot instance first, and create a directory named 'plugins' - add as many or as little plugins into this folder as you like.

Any plugins located in this folder will be automatically loaded when the bot starts up. That's it!

License
-------
This is dual-licensed under MIT and LGPL or something, so go nuts.
