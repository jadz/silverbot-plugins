A kiss is a lovely trick, designed by nature, to stop words when speech becomes superfluous,
My night has become a sunny dawn because of you,
In real love you want the other person's good. In romantic love you want the other person,
In dreams and in love there are no impossibilities,
Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies,
Each moment of a happy lover's hour is worth an age of dull and common life,
Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me,
In my wildest dreams, you always play the hero. In my darkest hour of night, you rescue me, you save my life,
What I do and what I dream include thee, as the wine must taste of its own grapes,
Take away love, and our earth is a tomb,
But to see her was to love her, love but her, and love her forever,
Like music on the waters is they sweet voice to me,
I love you, not only for what you are, But for what I am when I am with you,
You're nothing short of my everything.,
The only true gift is a portion of yourself,
Thou art to me a delicious torment,
Love distills desire upon the eyes, love brings bewitching grace into the heart,
I love her and that's the beginning of everything,
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own,
Where we love is home, home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts,
What I feel for you seems less of earth and more of a cloudless heaven,
Two souls with but a single thought, two hearts that beat as one,
When you came, you were like red wine and honey, and the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness,
Make me immortal with a kiss,
Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars,
Love is the enchanted dawn of every heart,
In the arithmetic of love, one plus one equals everything, and two minus one equals nothing,
We came by night to the Fortunate Isles, And lay like fish Under the net of our kisses,
In love there are two things: bodies and words,
I become a waterwheel, turning and tasting you, as long as water moves,
I miss you even more than I could have believed; and I was prepared to miss you a good deal,
Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction,
It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye,
There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved,
My heart is ever at your service,
The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite,
Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the recognition,
I am my beloved, and my beloved is me,
Her breath is like honey spiced with cloves, Her mouth delicious as a ripened mango,
To love is to receive a glimpse of heaven,
Love, till dawn sunder night from day with fire Dividing my delight and my desire,
Love is friendship set on fire,
Within you I lose myself. Without you I find myself wanting to become lost again,
I see my fated stars in your eyes. They melt me like the sun does snow,
The rose speaks of love silently, in a language known only to the heart,
To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed,
If I could reach up and hold a star for every time you made me smile, I would have the whole night sky in the palm of my hand,
If you love me only in my dreams, let me be asleep forever,
Kiss me and you will see stars; love me and I will give them to you,
Love is a dream that comes alive when we meet.,
The soul that can speak with its eyes can also kiss with a gaze,
Love is something eternal; the aspect may change, but not the essense,
Harmony is pure love, for love is a concerto,
Here are fruits, flowers, leaves, and branches, And here is my heart which beats only for you,
When a heart finds another, what's a cloud more or less in the sky,
The most precious possession that ever comes to a man in this world is a woman's heart.,
You come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly,
The most powerful symptom of love is a tenderness which becomes at times almost insupportable,
True love begins when nothing is looked for in return,
The life and love we create is the life and love we live,
Listening is an attitude of the heart, a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals,
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage,
The most eloquent silence; that of two mouths meeting in a kiss,
Since love grows within you, so beauty grows. For love is the beauty of the soul,
